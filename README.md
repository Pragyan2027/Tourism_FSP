**Project Summary – Online Tourism & Hotel Booking System**

This project is a **web-based tourism management application** designed to simplify travel planning by enabling users to register, explore tours, and book hotels online. Built using **Java Servlets** on **Apache Tomcat Server**, the project leverages **Eclipse IDE** for development and integrates with a **MySQL database** through **JDBC** for smooth data handling.

The system provides two main modules:

1. **User Module** – Visitors can register, log in, search for tours, and book hotels easily through a simple, user-friendly interface.
2. **Admin Module** – Administrators can manage tour packages, add/update/delete hotels, and view booking records.

Key features include:

* **Secure login & registration system** for users.
* **Dynamic tour search and hotel booking** powered by database connectivity.
* **Efficient database management** using SQL queries for bookings, tours, and user data.
* **Scalable design** for future expansion (adding payments, reviews, etc.).

This project demonstrates how **Java EE technologies** (Servlets + JDBC) can be combined with a relational database (MySQL) to build a real-world web application. It highlights **practical knowledge of backend programming, database connectivity, and web development frameworks**, making it a solid foundation for modern e-tourism applications.
